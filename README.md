* ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Interactive player** with play/pause, skip, track progress, and volume controls
* üíæ **Manage library** by liking tracks, saving albums, and creating playlists in your Spotify account

> üîí **Note:** A **Spotify Premium** subscription is required to stream audio through the Web API.

## üîß Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:

```bash
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ID
CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ID
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/spotify/callback
